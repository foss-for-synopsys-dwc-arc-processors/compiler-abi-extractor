# ABI Conformity Checker

This repository tracks the development of a toolset capable of validating that different RISC-V compilers follow the same ABI convention. Running the testsuites allow to identify where a particular compiler deviates from the ABI.

- abi-extract-info: This tool extracts the ABI from a compiler for a specified architecture and generates a summary report.
